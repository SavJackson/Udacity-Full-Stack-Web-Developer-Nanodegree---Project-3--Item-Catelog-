# Item Catelog 
---
#### Project Overview
Develop an application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories as well as provide a user registration and authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items.


#### Why This Project?
Modern web applications perform a variety of functions and provide amazing features and utilities to their users; but deep down, it’s really all just creating, reading, updating and deleting data. In this project, you’ll combine your knowledge of building dynamic websites with persistent data storage to create a web application that provides a compelling service to your users.


#### What I Learned?
- How to develop a Restful web application using the Python framework Flask along with implementing third-party OAuth authentication. 
- CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations.
